## :bulb: Concept

![Concept](https://github.com/lottekoblens/frontenddata/blob/master/concept.gif)

I've been working on this project for two weeks. In those two weeks I had to make a visualization with D3 and React. I displayed the data of the most popular songs of The Netherlands in a bar chart. The bar chart has a filter with two options:

* Show the duration of the song
* Show the amount of listeners of the song.

On the y scale the name of the song will be displayed as you can see above. 

I also added an hover. With this hover the data about the bar on which you hover will be displayed. This can also be seen above in the gif.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Proces

If you want to know more about my proces. You can read my [Wiki](https://github.com/lottekoblens/frontend-applications/wiki)!

## :wrench: Installation

If you want to use this code you have to clone the repository by putting this in your terminal: 

``` git clone https://github.com/lottekoblens/frontend-applications.git```

## :file_folder:	 Data

The data I use, is fetched from the API Last.fm. I fetch the top numbers of The Netherlands. Then I use the name of the song, the duration of the song and the amount of listeners.
